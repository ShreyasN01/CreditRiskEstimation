## Introduction

Credit risk estimation is a critical task for financial institutions to assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project implements various boosting ensemble methods to predict credit risk, aiming to improve prediction accuracy by combining the strengths of multiple models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is assumed to contain historical credit information with features that are relevant for predicting credit risk. The exact dataset is not provided in this repository. Users are expected to supply their own dataset or use publicly available datasets such as those from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyasN01/CreditRiskEstimation.git
   cd CreditRiskEstimation
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open `Boosting_Ensemble.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to train and evaluate the boosting ensemble models.

## Models

The notebook implements the following boosting ensemble methods:

- **AdaBoost:** A boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
- **Gradient Boosting:** A machine learning technique for regression and classification problems that builds a prediction model in a stage-wise fashion.
- **XGBoost:** An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable.

Each model is trained and evaluated on the provided dataset, with hyperparameter tuning performed to optimize performance.

## Results

The results section in the notebook provides detailed evaluation metrics for each model, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated to help interpret the model performance.
